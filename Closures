// Closures in Javascript
// A closure is the combination of a function bundled togethe(enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
In other words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope.
In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.


finction x(){
    var a=7;
    function y(){
        console.log(a)''
    }
    y();
}
x();
